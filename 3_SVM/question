Classifying MNIST with SVM's

Instructions
Hi all, 
 
As mentioned in the last session. This is an assignment to be done in groups of 3. After discussing with other teachers, they have suggested it might be better that I make the groups in a more or less balanced way (in terms of backgrounds). Thus I have split you in groups of 3, find your groups attached in the pdf below. I will probably change the groups for each assignment, this way you can work with other people as well. I hope this is not too inconvenient.
 
The reason that I'm putting you in groups is so that the ones that are more confident with the subject can help the ones that are less familiar with maths or programming. Nevertheless I am asking all of you to get involved in the assignments, do not let the others do the work for you (or you will not make friends and die alone :)).
  
IMPORTANT: the code of the assignments should obviously work and be readable. But I will be evaluating your reasoning about what you are doing rather than the code itself. So please write markdown cells with your comments and explanations!!
 
Good luck to you all, let the hunger games begin!
